# pandas-challenge-1

## OVERVIEW
The goal behind this challenge is to utilize pandas to examine and transform dataframes. At the beginning of the code, a dataframe is read in and examined using different pandas methods. Once this is done, the top clients are identified and consolidated into a list. The data is then transformed by applying mathematic operations to different columns to create new columns of additional value. When this is completed, the operations are validated by printing the total price of three specific order IDs. Lastly, the data is summarized and renamed to be more customer-facing.
